#Fb Live Video Reactions

## Overview
This project is inspired by the Live Video Reactions on Facebook.  have used RxJava2 for handling the stream of reactions (like,love,haha,wow,sad,angry). I have put one extra condition that the time duration between two reactions should be atleast 300 ms. This is achieved very easily by RxJava by using Flowable<Timed>.
